## Database Schema

The system uses a relational database with the following tables:

### 1. Books
Stores information about books in the library.
| Column        | Type         | Description                              |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Book_ID`     | INT          | Unique identifier (Primary Key)          |
| `Title`       | VARCHAR      | Title of the book                       |
| `Author`      | VARCHAR      | Author of the book                      |
| `Category`    | VARCHAR      | Genre or category of the book           |
| `Available`   | BOOLEAN      | Availability status (1 = available, 0 = borrowed) |

### 2. Members
Stores information about library members.
| Column        | Type         | Description                              |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Member_ID`   | INT          | Unique identifier (Primary Key)          |
| `Name`        | VARCHAR      | Full name of the member                 |
| `Email`       | VARCHAR      | Email address (UNIQUE)                  |

### 3. Borrowed_Books
Tracks borrowing records linking books to members.
| Column        | Type         | Description                              |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `Borrow_ID`   | INT          | Unique identifier (Primary Key)          |
| `Member_ID`   | INT          | Foreign Key referencing `Members`        |
| `Book_ID`     | INT          | Foreign Key referencing `Books`          |
| `Borrow_Date` | DATE         | Date the book was borrowed              |

**Relationships**:
- `Books.Book_ID` → `Borrowed_Books.Book_ID` (Foreign Key)
- `Members.Member_ID` → `Borrowed_Books.Member_ID` (Foreign Key)

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Add Books
- Inserts new book records into the `Books` table.
- Sets default availability to `1` (available).

### 2. Register Members
- Adds new member records to the `Members` table.
- Ensures email uniqueness with constraints.

### 3. Borrow Books
- Creates a borrowing record in `Borrowed_Books`.
- Updates `Books` table to mark the book as unavailable (`Available = 0`).
- Uses transactions to ensure data consistency.

### 4. Return Books
- Deletes the borrowing record from `Borrowed_Books`.
- Updates `Books` table to mark the book as available (`Available = 1`).
- Uses transactions for reliable operations.

---

## Analytical Insights

The system provides the following analytical queries:
1. **List All Available Books**:
   - Retrieves titles, authors, and categories of books where `Available = 1`.
2. **Books Borrowed by a Member**:
   - Fetches book details and borrowing dates for a specific `Member_ID`.
3. **Total Books by Category**:
   - Groups books by `Category` and counts the total in each group.
4. **Active Borrowers**:
   - Lists members who have borrowed books, including their names and emails.
