Overview
The Library Book Tracking System is a relational database-driven application designed to streamline library operations. It enables librarians to manage books, register members, track borrowing and returning activities, and generate analytical reports for better decision-making.

Features

Book Management: Add, update, delete, and retrieve book details including title, author, category, and availability.
Member Management: Register and manage library members with details like name and email.
Borrowing and Returning: Record and track book borrowing and returning activities, ensuring accurate availability status.
Analytical Insights:
List of currently borrowed books.
Borrowing history for individual members.
Statistics on most borrowed books and category-wise book counts.


Data Integrity: Enforced through primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
Performance Optimization: Indexing and transaction management for efficient operations.


Database Schema
The system uses a relational database with the following tables:
1. Books
Stores information about books in the library.



Column
Type
Description



Book_ID
INT
Unique identifier (Primary Key)


Title
VARCHAR
Title of the book


Author
VARCHAR
Author of the book


Category
VARCHAR
Genre or category of the book


Available
BOOLEAN
Availability status (1 = available, 0 = borrowed)


2. Members
Stores information about library members.



Column
Type
Description



Member_ID
INT
Unique identifier (Primary Key)


Name
VARCHAR
Full name of the member


Email
VARCHAR
Email address (UNIQUE)


3. Borrowed_Books
Tracks borrowing records linking books to members.



Column
Type
Description



Borrow_ID
INT
Unique identifier (Primary Key)


Member_ID
INT
Foreign Key referencing Members


Book_ID
INT
Foreign Key referencing Books


Borrow_Date
DATE
Date the book was borrowed


Relationships:

Books.Book_ID → Borrowed_Books.Book_ID (Foreign Key)
Members.Member_ID → Borrowed_Books.Member_ID (Foreign Key)


Core Functionalities
1. Add Books

Inserts new book records into the Books table.
Sets default availability to 1 (available).

2. Register Members

Adds new member records to the Members table.
Ensures email uniqueness with constraints.

3. Borrow Books

Creates a borrowing record in Borrowed_Books.
Updates Books table to mark the book as unavailable (Available = 0).
Uses transactions to ensure data consistency.

4. Return Books

Deletes the borrowing record from Borrowed_Books.
Updates Books table to mark the book as available (Available = 1).
Uses transactions for reliable operations.


Analytical Insights
The system provides the following analytical queries:

List All Available Books:
Retrieves titles, authors, and categories of books where Available = 1.


Books Borrowed by a Member:
Fetches book details and borrowing dates for a specific Member_ID.


Total Books by Category:
Groups books by Category and counts the total in each group.


Active Borrowers:
Lists members who have borrowed books, including their names and emails.




Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

Database Management System (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
SQL client or interface for executing queries
Optional: Programming language (e.g., Python, Java) for application integration

Installation Steps

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-book-tracking-system.git


Set Up the Database:
Create a new database in your DBMS.
Execute the SQL schema (provided in schema.sql) to create tables.


Configure Application:
Update database connection settings in the application configuration file.


Run the Application:
Follow language-specific instructions to start the application.




Usage
Example Queries

Add a Book:
INSERT INTO Books (Book_ID, Title, Author, Category, Available)
VALUES (1, 'The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 'Fiction', 1);


Register a Member:
INSERT INTO Members (Member_ID, Name, Email)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');


Borrow a Book:
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO Borrowed_Books (Borrow_ID, Member_ID, Book_ID, Borrow_Date)
VALUES (1, 1, 1, CURDATE());
UPDATE Books SET Available = 0 WHERE Book_ID = 1;
COMMIT;


Return a Book:
START TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM Borrowed_Books WHERE Borrow_ID = 1;
UPDATE Books SET Available = 1 WHERE Book_ID = 1;
COMMIT;


List Available Books:
SELECT Title, Author, Category FROM Books WHERE Available = 1;




Optimization Strategies

Indexing:

Create indexes on:
Books.Book_ID
Members.Member_ID
Borrowed_Books.Book_ID
Borrowed_Books.Member_ID


Improves query performance for frequent lookups and joins.


Query Optimization:

Analyze query execution plans to optimize joins and filters.
Use efficient joins (e.g., INNER JOIN) for borrowing queries.


Constraints:

Enforce NOT NULL for required fields.
Use UNIQUE constraints on Members.Email.
Implement foreign key constraints for data integrity.


Transaction Management:

Use transactions for borrow/return operations to ensure atomicity.
